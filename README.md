ansible-scaleio
===============

ansible-scaleio is a way to manage [ScaleIO](http://www.emc.com/storage/scaleio/index.htm "ScaleIO") through [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home "Ansible").

## Description

ansible-scaleio let's you do the following with Ansible (version 2 is supported) and ScaleIO:

- Install ScaleIO

- Configure the different roles:
  - mdm
  - sds
  - tb
  - lia
  - callhome (for version 1.3x only)
  - gateway (to be used for API gateway mainly)
  - sdc
  - gui

- For the sds you can setup different type of storage.

Important: master is tracking with ScaleIO 2.0 and up, for ScaleIO 1.3x use tag v1.3 of this repository, no further development on the 1.3x version of ScaleIO will be performed.

## Installation

To install ansible-scaleio just clone the repo and see site.yml as a generic playbook. If you are using Vagrant you can actually use the Vagrantfile in the appropriate tests folder to launch an environment to play with.

## Requirements

- Hosts should be bootstrapped for ansible usage (have python,...)
- Root privileges, eg `become: yes`

## Role Variables

 Some required variables are set in `site.yml` so please check then out, they mainly relates to your network setup and
 node naming.

 | Variable | Description | Default value |
 |----------|-------------|---------------|
 | `scaleio_mdm_primary_ip` | Primary MDM IP addresses (can be comma separated)| `{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][0]]['ansible_'+scaleio_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_primary_hostname`| Primary MDM hostname | `"{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][0]]['inventory_hostname'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_secondary_ip` | Secondary MDM IP addresses (can be comma separated)| `{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][1]]['ansible_'+scaleio_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_secondary_hostname`| Secondary MDM hostname | `"{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][1]]['inventory_hostname'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_tertiary_ip` | Tertiary MDM IP addresses (can be comma separated), if 5_node mode| `{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][2]]['ansible_'+scaleio_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_tertiary_hostname`| Tertiary MDM hostname | `"{{ hostvars[groups['mdm'][2]]['inventory_hostname'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_tb_primary_ip` | Primary TB IP addresses (can be comma separated)| `{{ hostvars[groups['tb'][0]]['ansible_'+scaleio_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_tb_primary_hostname`| Primary TB hostname | `"{{ hostvars[groups['tb'][0]]['inventory_hostname'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_tb_secondary_ip` | Secondary TB IP addresses (can be comma separated), if 5_node mode| `{{ hostvars[groups['tb'][1]]['ansible_'+scaleio_interface]['ipv4']['address'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_tb_secondary_hostname`| Secondary TB hostname | `"{{ hostvars[groups['tb'][1]]['inventory_hostname'] }}"` |
 | `scaleio_mdm_ips`| List of MDM IP's, depends on 3_node or 5_node mode | `"{{ scaleio_mdm_secondary_ip }},{{scaleio_mdm_primary_ip}}"` or `{{ scaleio_mdm_secondary_ip }},{{scaleio_mdm_primary_ip}},{{scaleio_mdm_tertiary_ip}` |

## Usage Instructions

Customize the roles and playbooks to your environment, you can use this to either to install ScaleIO or just enable the different modules on the nodes.

```
  ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

## Future

- Extend to do more special setup with cache
- Clean up the code (always more cleanup)
- Upgrade between ScaleIO releases.
